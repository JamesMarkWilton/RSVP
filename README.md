RSVP Indiviual Project
=====================

Solo project for the 13th week of Code Platoon. In this project we were directed to create
a basic Rails App that allowed:

The Host
--------
- [] As someone who hosts events,
- [] I want a convenient way to invite people
- [] and know who is planning on attending.
- [] When I go to the main page of the site,
- [] I see form that lets me enter details for my event.
- [] I enter "Josh's Birthday Party" for the title
- [] And I enter "14 March 2017" for the date
- [] And I enter "8:00 PM" for the time
- [] And I enter "8492 Main st." for the location
- [] And I enter "Come celebrate my birthday!" for the description
- [] When I submit the form
- [] I see that I'm on a page where I can sign up.

The Attendee
------------
- [] As someone who wants to attend Josh's birthday party
- [] When he gives me a link to the event
- [] I see the title is "Josh's Birthday Party"
- [] And I see the date is "14 March 2017"
- [] And I see the time is "8:00 PM"
- [] And I see the location is "8492 Main st."
- [] And I see the description is "Come celebrate my birthday!"
- [] I see that there are no attendees
- [] I see a form where I can RSVP
- [] When I enter "Brant Faulkner" into the form and submit it
- [] Then am left on the same page
- [] But now I see that "Brant Faulkner" is listed as an attendee
